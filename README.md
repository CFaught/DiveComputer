# DiveComputer
This is a dive computer written in Java to calculate End-of-Dive letter group, Surface Interval TIme, and Repetitive Dive times. I am currently focusing on Non-Decompression diving as that is the most common recreational diving and probably safest. Dive calculations are using NAUI dive tables until I can get the Navy dive tables implemented.
